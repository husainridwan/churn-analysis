# Churn-analysis

### Description
Dashboard to show the different factors that affect the churn rate of a call center.

### Insights
This is a dashboard that displays different factors that affect the churn rate of customers for a call center. These factors have been separated into Demographics, 
Customer Account information & Services. 
It was observed that majority of the customers at risk of not using the services again used Electronic check as payment menthod and about 90% of them subscribed to 
monthly plans. Customers with partners generally spent over $1200 more than those without partners monthly on Paperless billing.
A third of the customers that have partners that are at risk of churn use more of the streaming services and pay more in charges compared to others.

### Proposed Solution
In order to reduce the churn rate among customers, it would be helpful if the following are implemented:
- Reduce the charges for customers that pay for yearly contract to encourage longer usage of services.
- Customers with partners & dependents should get improved payment plans and lesser charges.
- Other payment methods should be encouraged among customers as they might find electronic check stressful.
- The TechSupport & OnlineSecurity services should be improved so customers can have effective assistance with issues.
